Python holiday control center with easy expandability for various setups and programs in one place.


Description
===========

The initial idea is based on the necessity to create various holiday decorations and props and make them readily deployable on the plethora of hardware available today. The core principles of the project are to have it be easily editable and easily expanded upon. From Christmas lights to Halloween props, pyHoliday should be able to control them all!

The short term plan is to support Linux, Raspberry Pi and C.H.I.P. as this is what I am currently working with.


Note
====

pyHoliday is in early stages and most likely will have problems!

This project has been set up using PyScaffold 2.5.8. For details and usage
